# Course 2 - Complete Intro for Linux and Command Line

# Introduction
The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer.

Also known as shell, terminal, console, command prompts and many others, is a computer program intended to interpret commands.

Allows users to execute commands by manually typing at the terminal, or has the ability to automatically execute commands which were programmed in “Shell Scripts”.

## A bit of history
The Bourne Shell (sh) was originally developed by Stephen Bourne while working at Bell Labs.

Released in 1979 in the Version 7 Unix release distributed to colleges and universities.

The Bourne Again Shell (bash) was written as a free and open source replacement for the Bourne Shell.

Given the open nature of Bash, over time it has been adopted as the default shell on most Linux systems.

## Distros Linux
Linux Distros are Linux operating systems built on the Linux kernel, plus components of a package management system. this component originates from and is GNU-style. It also includes a display or server display and its desktop environment, for use on ordinary desktop operating systems.
